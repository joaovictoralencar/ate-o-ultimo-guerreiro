/*

This active selector implementation reuses the bulk of the underlying Selector code,
and forces it to run every tick by calling onInitialize(). Then, if a different child node is
selected the previous one is shutdown afterwards. Separately, the m_Current iterator is
initialized to the end of the children vector. Keep in mind that forcefully aborting lower-priority
behaviors can have unwanted side effects if youâ€™re not careful;
