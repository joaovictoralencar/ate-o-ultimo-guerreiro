/*
The easiest way to set this up is to reuse the parallel node implementation, as a Monitor
node can be thought of as a parallel behavior with two sub-trees; one containing conditions
which express the assumptions to be monitored (read-only), and the other tree of
behaviors (readâ€“write). Separating the conditions in one branch from the behaviors in the
other prevents synchronization and contention problems, since only one sub-tree will be
running actions that make changes in the world
